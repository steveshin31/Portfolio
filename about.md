<p>Hi my name is Stephen and I am currently a second year MS student studying Biostatistics at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, I moved to the U.S. with my sister and my mother in search of better education and opportunity. Growing up, I fell in love with the game of basketball and used it as a means to incorporate myself into the U.S. culture and society.</p>

<p>I acquired my Bachelors Degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and it was here where I discovered my love for Biostatistics and data science as a whole. There is a special feeling of power and significance one can get as a Biostatistician; the fact that I can analyze data from millions of patients and derive meaningful public health findings from behind a small computer amazes me everyday! </p>
