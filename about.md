<p>Hi my name is Kee-Young Shin, but you can call me Stephen! I am currently a second year MS student studying Biostatistics at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, I moved to the U.S. with my sister and my mother in search of better education and opportunity at the age of 6. Growing up, I fell in love with the game of basketball and used it as a means to incorporate myself into the US culture and society. Basketball played a paramount role in creating my personal identity and establishing ever-lasting relationships, and to this day I am deeply passionate about the sport.</p>

<p>I acquired my Bachelors Degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and it was here where I discovered my love for Biostatistics and data science as a whole. There is a special feeling of power and significance one can get as a data analyst; the fact that I can analyze immense datasets and derive meaningful real world conclusions from behind a small computer amazes me everyday! </p>
